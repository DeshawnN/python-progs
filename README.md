# Misc Python Progs
==============

Hello and Welcome to my *Python* Program repository.

Here you can find miscellaneous programs I've made in python.

I also dabble a bit in Web Development, feel free to check out my Github pages site at:
https://DeshawnN.github.io/

I know other programming languages such as *C/C++*, a little *Ruby*, a tiny bit of *Java(, and 
I'm currently studying some android development. And as such, in the future I'll try to ensure that 
the programs and modules are ported over to those other languages.

Anyways, Thanks for stopping by, and I wish you all well.

## Code Overview

### Strings

#### String Reverser
This is a simple program I whipped up during my lunch break.

It works like this, You'll be prompted to enter a string and it will reverse your string and display it.

#### Vowel Counter
This program counts the like the String reverser, takes a string at a user input prompt, then it counts the number of vowels in that string and outputs the number.

#### Palindrome Checker
This program takes in a user inputted string and checks if it is the same backwards as it is forward.

#### Word Counter
This program takes in a user inputted string and counts however many words are in the string and outputs the number.

### Algorithms

#### FizzBuzzinator
This program is a little bit more complex than anything in my strings section.

This program was designed from the ground up to help people struggling to understand the logic behind the FizzBuzz problem by letting them make their own custom problems without having to muck around with any code.

Currently it's a bit bare, but I'll keep adding to it until I'm satisfied with it.
