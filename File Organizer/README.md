### Overview

An Intermediate project, a file organizing script.

Not much else can be said about it, input a directory (or just press enter at the prompt to target your current working directory, i.e. the folder the script is in), and the script then creates folders for your file types, e.g. Music, Video, Images, etc. and moves you files to those respective folders. Don't worry about the folder's it creates, they'll instantly be deleted if they remain empty by the end of the script's runtime.

### Instructions

3. ????
4. Profit
